## Technical Details

### MCP Integration

The tool integrates with the DeepWiki MCP server:

- **Server URL**: `https://mcp.deepwiki.com`
- **Protocol**: SSE (Server-Sent Events)
- **Authentication**: None required for public repos
- **Tools Available**:
  1. `read_wiki_structure` - Get documentation topics
  2. `read_wiki_contents` - Get full documentation
  3. `ask_question` - AI-powered Q&A

### Tool Schema

```typescript
{
  action: 'read_wiki_structure' | 'read_wiki_contents' | 'ask_question',
  repo_name: string, // format: "owner/repo"
  question?: string  // required for ask_question
}
```

### Response Format

```typescript
{
  success: boolean,
  output?: string,  // Formatted documentation or answer
  error?: string    // Error message if failed
}
```

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Learning React
```
User: "Help me understand React hooks"
Agent: [Uses DeepWiki ask_question on facebook/react]
Agent: "React hooks are functions that let you use state and lifecycle features..."
```

### Example 2: Understanding Express
```
User: "How does Express middleware work?"
Agent: [Uses DeepWiki ask_question on expressjs/express]
Agent: "Express middleware are functions that have access to request, response..."
```

### Example 3: Exploring a New Library
```
User: "I need to use NestJS for my project"
Agent: [Uses DeepWiki read_wiki_structure on nestjs/nest]
Agent: [Uses DeepWiki read_wiki_contents]
Agent: "NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework. Here's the architecture..."
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
1. `src/tools/student/deepwiki.ts` - Main tool implementation
2. `DEEPWIKI_SETUP.md` - User documentation
3. `docs/deepwiki-tool-reference.md` - Technical reference
4. `DEEPWIKI_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` - This file

### Modified Files
1. `src/tools/index.ts` - Added tool registration
2. `PROJECT_PLAN.md` - Updated Phase 6.3 status
